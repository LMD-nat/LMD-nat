Bonjour-Hi, I’m Nathalie from Montréal.
 
I'm starting a master's degree at Université Laval in epidemiology in Fall 2021. I have a BA (honours) in psychology from Concordia.
 
I’m currently learning all about cognition and how people make choices at the [LDMLab](http://www.ldmlab.org/).
 
Also interested in bilingualism, open science, and programming.
 
Give me a ring ([or a click, technically](mailto:nathalie.germain@mail.concordia.ca)).
