 👋  Bonjour-Hi, I’m Nathalie from Montréal. The "h" is silent.
 
 ⚕️  I'm starting a master's degree at ULaval in epidemiology in Fall 2021.
 
 🌱  I’m currently learning all about cognition and how people make choices at the [LDMLab](http://www.ldmlab.org/).
 
 🗣  Also interested in bilingualism, open science, and programming.
 
 ☎️  Give me a ring ([or a click?](mailto:nathalie.germain@mail.concordia.ca)).
