Bonjour-Hi, I’m Nathalie from Montréal. I am an MSc student in epidemiology at Université Laval in Québec City, Canada. 

I'll be researching how decision-making affects patient outcomes. I know R and JavaScript pretty well, and I'm learning SAS, SQL, and Python currently. 

I currently collaborate with the [Lifespan and Decision-Making Lab](http://www.ldmlab.org/) at Concordia, where I got my BA. 

I'm also interested in bilingualism, open science, and programming. I speak English and French fluently. Please don't be shy to reach out to me at [nathalie.germain.5@ulaval.ca](mailto:nathalie.germain.5@ulaval.ca).
